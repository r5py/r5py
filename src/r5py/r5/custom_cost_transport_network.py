        Initialise a TransportNetwork with custom impedances.

        Supports single or multiple cost factor sets.
        Must always have the same number of:
        names, sensitivities, and custom_cost_segment_weight_factors, and also allow_missing_osmids if multiple provided.
        Multiple datasets so lists of parameters are paired together by "index" order using zip.
        So the first parameters of each parameter list are used together, then the second ones, and so on.

        Arguments
        ---------
        osm_pbf : str | pathlib.Path
            file path of an OpenStreetMap extract in PBF format
        gtfs : str | pathlib.Path | list[str] | list[pathlib.Path]
            path(s) to public transport schedule information in GTFS format
        custom_costs : pandas.DataFrame()
            A DataFrame indexed by OSM IDs, each column is a custom impedance
            that is applied to the respective edges, the column names are used
            the name of the custom costs
        sensitivities : dict[str : float]
            Apply an over-all weight to one or more columns. A dict, the keys
            are column/cost names, the values sensitivity coefficients
        allow_missing_values : bool | List[bool], default True
            Define whether to allow missing values in custom costs.
        precalculate : False or float, default False
            If a positive numeric value, precalculate the transport network
            before routing with this walking or cycling speed (in km/h).
            This potentially speeds up repeated routing for large networks.
