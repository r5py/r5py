	abstract = {{\textless}strong{\textgreater}R5py{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} is a Python library for rapid realistic routing on multimodal transport networks (walk, bike, public transport and car). It provides a simple and friendly interface to R$^{\textrm{5}}$, the Rapid Realistic Routing on Real-world and Reimagined networks, the routing engine developed by Conveyal. {\textless}code{\textgreater}r5py{\textless}/code{\textgreater} is inspired by r5r, a wrapper for R, and the library is designed to interact with GeoPandas GeoDataFrames. {\textless}code{\textgreater}R5py{\textless}/code{\textgreater} offers a simple way to run R5 locally with Python, allowing the users to calculate travel time matrices and accessibility by different travel modes. To get started, see a detailed demonstration of the {\textless}code{\textgreater}r5py{\textless}/code{\textgreater} in action from the Usage -section. Over time, {\textless}code{\textgreater}r5py{\textless}/code{\textgreater} will be expanded to incorporate other functionalities from R5.},

	abstract = {Most analyses of accessibility by public transit have focused on travel time and not considered the cost of transit fares. It is difficult to include fares in shortest-path algorithms because fares are often path-dependent. When fare policies allow discounted transfers, for example, the fare for a given journey segment depends on characteristics of previous journey segments. Existing methods to characterize tradeoffs between travel time and monetary cost objectives do not scale well to complex networks, or they rely on approximations. Additionally, they often require assumed values of time, which may be problematic for evaluating the equity of service provision. We propose a new method that allows us to find Pareto sets of paths, jointly minimizing fare and travel time. Using a case study in greater Boston, Massachusetts, USA, we test the algorithm’s performance as part of an interactive web application for computing accessibility metrics. Potential extensions for journey planning and route choice models are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Accessibility is increasingly used as a metric when evaluating changes to public transport systems. Transit travel times contain variation depending on when one departs relative to when a transit vehicle arrives, and how well transfers are coordinated given a particular timetable. In addition, there is 
necessarily uncertainty in the value of the accessibility metric during sketch planning processes, due to scenarios which are underspecified because detailed schedule information is not yet available. This article presents a method to extend the concept of "reliable" accessibility to transit to address the first issue, and create confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to address the second.},

	abstract = {There is a need for indicators of transportation–land use system quality that are understandable to a wide range of stakeholders and that can provide immediate feedback on the quality of interactively designed scenarios. Location-based accessibility indicators are promising candidates, but indicator values can vary strongly depending on time of day and transfer wait times. Capturing this variation increases complexity, slowing calculations. This paper presents new methods for rapid yet rigorous computation of accessibility metrics, allowing immediate feedback during early-stage transit planning while being rigorous enough for final analyses. The approach is statistical, characterizing the uncertainty and variability in accessibility metrics related to differences in departure time and headway-based scenario specification. The analysis was carried out on a detailed multimodal network model including both public transportation and streets. Land use data were represented at high resolution. These methods were implemented as open-source software running on a commodity cloud infrastructure. Networks were constructed from standard open data sources, and scenarios were built in a map-based web interface. A case study is presented, describing how these methods were applied in a long-term transportation planning process for an urbanized, polycentric Randstad region in the Netherlands.},
