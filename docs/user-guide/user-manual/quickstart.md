One of the core functionalities of *r5py* is to compute travel time matrices
efficiently, and for large extents such as entire cities or countries. This
page walks you through the - pleasantly few - steps required to do so.

In our example below, we work with sample data from Helsinki, the capital of
Finland. We calculate the travel times on public transport or on foot from all
cells in a population grid data set to the city’s main railway station.

## Origins and destination

As we intend to compute the travel times from the centre points of population grid
cells to the railway station, we need to know the locations of these places.

:::{admonition} Sample data set
:class: info

For this example, we prepared the data ahead of time. If you repeat the code
examples independently, [install
`r5py.sampledata.helsinki`](../installation/installation.md#sample-data-sets).

`r5py.sampledata.helsinki.population_grid` is a vector data set in [GeoPackage
(GPKG)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geopackage) format containing a
250 ⨉ 250 m grid covering parts of downtown Helsinki, and obtained from the
[Helsinki Region Environmental Services
(HSY)](https://hri.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/vaestotietoruudukko).

:::

We open the sample data set file using {meth}`geopandas.GeoDataFrame.read_file()`.

Because, in our example, we only use one destination, the railway station, we
define its location as a {class}`geopandas.GeoDataFrame` containing one
geometry, a {class}`shapely.Point`, the coordinates of which refer to Helsinki’s
main railway station in the
[`EPSG:4326`](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/) reference system.

```{code-cell}
import geopandas
import r5py.sampledata.helsinki
import shapely

population_grid = geopandas.read_file(r5py.sampledata.helsinki.population_grid)

railway_station = geopandas.GeoDataFrame(
    {
        "id": ["railway_station"],
        "geometry": [shapely.Point(24.94152, 60.17066)]
    },
    crs="EPSG:4326",
)
```

```{code-cell}
overview_map = population_grid.explore("population", cmap="Reds")
overview_map = railway_station.explore(m=overview_map, marker_type="marker")
overview_map
```

## Transport network

Virtually all operations of _r5py_ require a transport network. _R5py_
understands and reads the following types of transport networks:

- a street network, including infrastructure for cycling and walking, is
  loaded from an [OpenStreetMap
  extract](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Extracts) in _Protocol Buffer_
  (`.pbf`) format (mandatory)
- a public transport schedule from one or more
  [GTFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTFS) files (optional).

For the quickstart example, you find sample data sets in the
`r5py.sampledata.helsinki` package (see [above](#origins-and-destination)).

To import the street and public transport networks, instantiate an
{class}`r5py.TransportNetwork` with the file paths to the OSM extract and to
zero or more GTFS files. With the sample data set, the file paths are in the
`r5py.sampledata.helsinki` namespace:

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-output]

import r5py
import r5py.sampledata.helsinki

transport_network = r5py.TransportNetwork(
    r5py.sampledata.helsinki.osm_pbf,
    [r5py.sampledata.helsinki.gtfs],
)
```

At this stage, _r5py_ has created a routable transport network, that is stored
in the `transport_network` variable. We can now use this network for travel time
calculations. Depending on the extent of the network, this step can take up to
several minutes. Once loaded, you can reuse the same `TransportNetwork` instance
in subsequent analyses.

## Compute a travel time matrix

A travel time matrix is a dataset of the travel costs (typically, time) between
given locations (origins and destinations) in a study area.  In *r5py*,
{class}`TravelTimeMatrix<r5py.TravelTimeMatrix>`s calculate these matrices. A
{class}`TravelTimeMatrix<r5py.TravelTimeMatrix>` is a child instance of
{class}`pandas.DataFrame`: once values have been computed, it can be used just
like the data frames you are used to work with.

A {class}`TravelTimeMatrix<r5py.TravelTimeMatrix>` needs (at least)
the following input arguments:

- a `transport_network` ({class}`r5py.TransportNetwork`), such as the one we
  just created,
- `origins`, a {class}`geopandas.GeoDataFrame` with one or more points
  representing the departure points of routes,
- `destinations`, a {class}`geopandas.GeoDataFrame` with one or more points
  representing the destinations of routes,
- `departure`, a {class}`datetime.datetime`
  refering to the departure date and time for routing, and
- `transport_modes`, a list of {class}`r5py.TransportMode`s: the travel modes
  that will be used in the calculations

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-output]

import datetime

origins = population_grid.copy()
origins.geometry = origins.geometry.centroid

destinations = railway_station.copy()

travel_times = r5py.TravelTimeMatrix(
    transport_network,
    origins=origins,
    destinations=destinations,
    departure=datetime.datetime(2022, 2, 22, 8, 30),
    transport_modes=[
        r5py.TransportMode.TRANSIT,
        r5py.TransportMode.WALK,
    ],
    snap_to_network=True,
)
```

```{code-cell}
travel_times
```

As mentioned above, a {class}`TravelTimeMatrix<r5py.TravelTimeMatrix>` is also a
{class}`pandas.DataFrame`, (all methods of the latter can be
used)[https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe].  The
values in its `travel_time` column are travel times in minutes between the
points identified by `from_id` and `to_id` (the IDs of the origins and
destinations, respectively). As you can see, the `id` value in the `to_id`
column is the same for all rows because our example used only one destination
point (the railway station).

:::{admonition} Deprecated interface
:class: caution

Prior to r5py version 1.0.0, travel time matrices had to be computed by first
initialising a
{class}`TravelTimeMatrixComputer()<r5py.TravelTimeMatrixComputer>`, then calling
its
{func}`compute_travel_times()<r5py.TravelTimeMatrixComputer.compute_travel_times()>`.

This interface has now been **deprecated** and will be removed in a future
version.

## Save results

If you want to continue analysis later, in a different environment, or simply
retain a clean copy of the results, save the travel time matrix to a CSV file.
Simply use the {meth}`to_csv()<pandas.DataFrame.to_csv()>` method of pandas data
frames:

```{code-cell}
travel_times.to_csv("travel_times_to_helsinki_railway_station.csv")
```

## Plot a result map

To quickly plot the results in a map, _join_ the `travel_times` with the input
data set `population_grid` and
{meth}`explore()<geopandas.GeoDataFrame.explore()>` the joint data frame’s
data.

```{code-cell}
travel_times = population_grid.merge(travel_times, left_on="id", right_on="from_id")
travel_times.head()
```

```{code-cell}
travel_times.explore("travel_time", cmap="Greens")
```
