# Compute travel times with a detailed breakdown of the routing results

In case you are interested in more detailed routing results, you can use
{class}`DetailedItinerariesComputer<r5py.DetailedItinerariesComputer>`. In
contrast to {class}`TravelTimeMatrixComputer<r5py.TravelTimeMatrixComputer>`, it
reports individual trip segments, and possibly multiple options for each trip. 

As such,
{class}`DetailedItinerariesComputer<r5py.DetailedItinerariesComputer>`’s output
is structured in a different way, too. It provides one row per trip segment,
multiple trip segments together constitute a trip option, of which there might
be several per `from_id`/`to_id` pair. The results also include information on
the public transport routes (e.g., bus line numbers) used on the trip, as well
as a {class}`shapely.geometry` for each segment.

:::{admonition} Detailed itineraries are computationally expensive
:class: attention

Computing detailed itineraries is significantly more expensive than simple
travel times. As such, think twice whether you actually need the information
contained.

For the examples below, to reduce computation effort, we use a sample of 10
origin points and one single destination: the railway station. 

:::


```{code-cell}
:tags: ["remove-output"]

import datetime
import r5py

origins = population_grid.sample(10).copy()
origins.geometry = origins.geometry.centroid

destinations = geopandas.GeoDataFrame(
        {
            "id": [1],
            "geometry": [RAILWAY_STATION]
        },
        crs="EPSG:4326",
)

detailed_itineraries_computer = r5py.DetailedItinerariesComputer(
    transport_network,
    origins=origins,
    destinations=destinations,
    departure=datetime.datetime(2022,2,22,8,30),
    transport_modes=[r5py.TransportMode.TRANSIT, r5py.TransportMode.WALK],
    snap_to_network=True,
)
```

```{code-cell}
travel_details = detailed_itineraries_computer.compute_travel_details()
travel_details
```


As you can see, the result contains much more information than earlier.
Depending on your screen size, you might even have to scroll further right to
see all columns. 

Especially in the case of public transport routes, or when choosing a list of
different {attr}`transport_modes<r5py.RegionalTask.transport_modes>`, also the
table structure of the results is more complex: For each origin/destination
pair, one or more possible `option` is reported, which in turn can consist of
one or more `segment`s. Both options and segments are numbered sequentially,
starting at `0`.

Each segment, then, represents one row in the results table, and provides
information about the transport mode used for a segment, time travelled,
possible wait time (before the departure of a public transport vehicle), the
route (e.g., bus number, metro line), and finally a line geometry representing
the travelled path.

See the following table for a complete list of columns returned by
{meth}`DetailedItinerariesComputer.compute_detailed_itineraries()<r5py.DetailedItinerariesComputer.compute_detailed_itineraries()>`:


`from_id` (same type as `origins["id"]`)
: the origin of the trip this segment belongs to

`to_id` (same type as `origins["id"]`)
: the destination of the trip this segment belongs to

`option` ({class}`int`)
: sequential number enumerating the the different trip options found. Each trip
option consists of one or more trip segments. (starts with `0`)

`segment` ({class}`int`)
: sequential number enumerating the segments the current trip option consists
of. (starts with `0`)

`transport_mode` ({class}`r5py.TransportMode`)
: the transport mode used on the current segment

`departure_time` ({class}`datetime.datetime`)
: the departure date and time of the public transport vehicle used for the
current segment; `NaT` in case of other modes of transport

`distance` ({class}`float`)
: the distance travelled on the current segment, in metres. For public
transport, see [note below](detailed-geometries-with-upstream-r5).

`travel_time` ({class}`datetime.timedelta`)
: The time spent travelling on the current segment

`wait_time` ({class}`datetime.timedelta`)
: if the current segment is a public transport vehicle: wait time between the
arrival of the previous trip segment and the departure of the current segment.

`route` ({class}`str`)
: if the current segment is a public transport vehicle: the route number (or
other id), as specified in the input GTFS data set, e.g. bus numbers, metro line
names

`geometry` ({class}`shapely.LineString`)
: the path travelled on the current segment. For public transport, see [note
below](detailed-geometries-with-upstream-r5).

:::{admonition} Geometries of public transport routes, and distances travelled
:class: important

The default upstream version of R⁵ is compiled with
`com.conveyal.r5.transit.TransitLayer.SAVE_SHAPES = false`, which improves
performance by *not reading the geometries included in GTFS data sets*. 

As a consequence, the `geometry` reported by
{class}`DetailedItinerariesComputer` are straight lines in-between the stops of
a public transport line, and do not reflect the actual path travelled.

With this in mind, *r5py* does not attempt to compute the distance of public
transport segments if `SAVE_SHAPES = false`, as distances would be very crude
approximations, only. Instead it reports `NaN`/`None`.

The [Digital Geography Lab](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/digital-geography-lab) maintains a patched version of R⁵ in its [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/DigitalGeographyLab/r5/releases). If you want to refrain from compiling your own R⁵ jar, but still would like to use detailed geometries of public transport routes, follow the instructions in [Advanced usage](advanced-usage.md#use-a-custom-installation-of-r⁵).

## Visualise travel details

It’s not difficult to plot the detailed routes in a map, however, a couple more
steps are needed than with simple travel times. On the one hand, the resulting
table needs to be converted into a {class}`geopandas.GeoDataFrame`. On the other
hand, {meth}`GeoDataFrame.explore()<geopandas.GeoDataFrame.explore()>` cannot
handle the column types {class}`r5py.TransportMode` and
{class}`datetime.timedelta` - the conversion is quick and easy, though:

```{code-cell}
travel_details["mode"] = travel_details.transport_mode.astype(str)
travel_details["travel time (min)"] = travel_details.travel_time.apply(
    lambda t: round(t.total_seconds() / 60.0, 2)
)
travel_details["trip"] = travel_details.apply(
    lambda row: f"{row.from_id}→{row.to_id}",
    axis=1
)

m = (
    geopandas.GeoDataFrame(travel_details)
    .set_geometry("geometry")
    .set_crs("EPSG:4326")[
        [
            "geometry",
            "distance",
            "mode",
            "travel time (min)",
            "from_id",
            "to_id",
            "trip",
            "option",
            "segment",
        ]
    ]
    .explore(
        tooltip=["trip", "option", "segment", "mode", "travel time (min)", "distance"],
        column="mode",
        tiles="CartoDB.Positron",
    )
)
```

Let’s also add the origins to the map:

```{code-cell}

points = geopandas.GeoDataFrame(
    pandas.DataFrame(
        {"id": detailed_itineraries_computer.od_pairs["id_origin"].unique()}
    )
    .set_index("id")
    .join(population_grid.set_index("id"))
)
points.geometry = points.geometry.to_crs("EPSG:3875").centroid.to_crs("EPSG:4326")
points.explore(marker_kwds={"radius": 10}, tooltip={"id"}, m=m)

```
