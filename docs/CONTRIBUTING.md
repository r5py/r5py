# Contributing to r5py

Contributions of any kind to r5py are more than welcome. That does not mean
new code only, but also improvements of documentation and user guide, additional
tests (ideally filling the gaps in existing suite) or a bug report. In addition, we
warmly welcome ideas of new features that could be added to the r5py, 
or ideas how to improve the existing codebase.

All contributions should go through our GitHub repository. Bug reports, ideas or
even questions should be raised by opening an issue on the GitHub tracker.
Suggestions for changes in code or documentation should be submitted as a pull
request. However, if you are not sure what to do, feel free to open an issue.
All discussion will then take place on GitHub to keep the development of
r5py transparent.

If you decide to contribute to the codebase, ensure that you are using an
up-to-date `main` branch. The latest development version will always be there,
including the documentation (powered by [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)).

## Seven Steps for Contributing

There are seven basic steps to contributing to r5py:

1. Fork the r5py git repository
2. Create a development environment with r5py dependencies
3. Make a development build of r5py
4. Make changes to code and add tests
5. Update the documentation
6. Format code
7. Submit a Pull Request

Each of the steps is detailed below.

### 1. Fork the r5py git repository

Git can be complicated for new users, but you no longer need to use command line
to work with git. If you are not familiar with git, we recommend using tools on
Github.com, GitHub Desktop or tools with included git like Atom or PyCharm. However, if you
want to use command line, you can fork r5py repository using following:

    git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/r5py.git r5py-yourname
    cd r5py-yourname
    git remote add upstream git://github.com/r5py/r5py.git

This creates the directory `r5py-yourname` and connects your repository to
the upstream (main project) r5py repository.

Then simply create a new branch of main branch.

### 2. Create a development environment

A development environment is a virtual space where you can keep an independent
installation of r5py. This makes it easy to keep both a stable version of
python in one place you use for work, and a development version (which you may
break while playing with code) in another.

An easy way to create a r5py development environment is as follows:

- Install [MambaForge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) (or [install mamba using conda](https://r5py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#install-mamba)) 
- Make sure that you have **cloned the r5py repository**
- `cd` to the *r5py* source directory (the root folder)

Tell `mamba` to create a new environment from a [YAML file](https://github.com/r5py/r5py/blob/main/ci/python_311_dev.yaml) inside `ci` directory, by running:

      mamba env create -f ci/python_311_dev.yaml

This will create a new environment called `r5py`, and not touch any of your existing environments,
nor existing python installations. The environment includes all necessary dependencies for r5py, 
as well as optional packages for running tests and building docs. 
With this environment, you can directly start working with r5py.  

To work in this environment, you should `activate` it as follows:

      conda activate r5py

You will then see a confirmation message to indicate you are in the new development environment.

To view your environments:

      conda info -e

To return to you home root environment::

      deactivate

See the full conda docs [here](http://conda.pydata.org/docs).

### 3. Making a development build

Once dependencies are in place, make an in-place build by navigating to the git
clone of the *r5py* repository and run:

    pip install .

This will install r5py from the source into your environment.

### 4. Making changes and writing tests

*r5py* is serious about testing and strongly encourages contributors to embrace
[test-driven development (TDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).
This development process "relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:
first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired
improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test."
So, before actually writing any code, you should write your tests. Often the test can be
taken from the original GitHub issue. However, it is always worth considering additional
use cases and writing corresponding tests.

*r5py* uses the [pytest testing system](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest).

### Writing tests

All tests should go into the `tests` directory. This folder contains many
current examples of tests, and we suggest looking to these for inspiration.

#### Running the test suite

The tests can then be run directly inside your Git clone without having to
install *r5py*. Run the tests by typing (`v` means *verbose*):

    pytest -v

### 5. Updating the Documentation and User Guide

*r5py* documentation resides in the `docs` folder. Changes to the docs are
make by modifying the appropriate file within `docs`.
*r5py* docs use a combination of reStructuredText syntax [which is explained here](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html#rst-primer), 
Jupyter Notebooks ([read more here](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest)),
and the docstrings follow the [Numpy Docstring standard](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt).

Once you have made your changes, you may try if they render correctly by building the docs using Sphinx 
(comes with `r5py` environment if [installed from the YAML file](#2-create-a-development-environment)).
To do so, you can navigate to the docs folder and type:

    make html

The resulting html pages will be located in `docs/_build/html/`. 

For minor updates, you can skip whole make html part as reStructuredText syntax is
usually quite straightforward.

#### Updating User Guide

Updating user guide might be slightly more complicated as it
consists of collection of reStructuredText files and Jupyter notebooks.
Changes in reStructuredText are straightforward, changes in notebooks should be done using Jupyter. 
Once pushing changes, make sure that all the cells are **without outputs** as notebooks
are executed by readthedocs.

### 6. Formatting the code

#### Python (PEP8 / black)

*r5py* follows the [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) standard
and uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to ensure a consistent code format throughout the project.

CI will run `black --check` and fails if there are files which would be
auto-formatted by `black`. Therefore, it is helpful before submitting code to
auto-format your code::

    black src

Additionally, many editors have plugins that will apply `black` as you edit files.
If you don't have black, you can install it using pip:

    pip install black

#### Import order, import of submodules

**R5py** uses [jpype](https://jpype.readthedocs.io), with the help of which Java classes
can be imported using normal `import` statements. As a consequence, the order of import
statements at the beginning of source files plays a crucial role. 

By convention, in r5py source files, the import statements should be grouped in the 
following order:

1. Imports of modules of the Python Standard Library
2. Imports of third-party Python modules
3. Relative imports of other r5py modules
4. Imports of Java classes

The modules of each group should be sorted alphabetically, the groups be separated by an
empty line.

The import of submodules (`from ... import ...`), as well as the use of aliases for
imported modules (`import ... as ...`) are discouraged. An exception to this rule,
assets from other modules from within r5py should always be imported as submodules
(`from . import TravelTimeMatrixComputer`).


### 7. Submitting a Pull Request

Once you've made changes and pushed them to your forked repository, you then
submit a pull request to have them integrated into the *r5py* code base.

You can find a pull request (or PR) tutorial in the [GitHub's Help Docs](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
