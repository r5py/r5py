    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**R5py** is a Python library for routing and calculating travel time matrices on multimodal transport networks (walk, bike, public transport and car).\n",
    "It provides a simple and friendly interface to R<sup>5</sup> (*the Rapid Realistic Routing on Real-world and Reimagined networks*) which is a [routing engine](https://github.com/conveyal/r5) developed by [Conveyal](https://conveyal.com/). `R5py` is designed to interact with [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org) GeoDataFrames, and it is inspired by [r5r](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r) which is a similar wrapper developed for R. `R5py` exposes some of R5’s functionality via its [Python API](reference.html), in a syntax similar to r5r’s. At the time of this writing, only the computation of travel time matrices has been fully implemented. Over time, `r5py` will be expanded to incorporate other functionalities from R5. "

    "## Data requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data for creating a routable network\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating travel times with `r5py`, you typically need a couple of datasets: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **A road network dataset from OpenStreetMap** (OSM) in Protocolbuffer Binary (`.pbf`) format: \n",
    "  - This data is used for finding the fastest routes and calculating the travel times based on walking, cycling and driving. In addition, this data is used for walking/cycling legs between stops when routing with transit. \n",
    "  - *Hint*: Sometimes you might need modify the OSM data beforehand, e.g., by cropping the data or adding special costs for travelling (e.g., for considering slope when cycling/walking). When doing this, you should follow the instructions on the [Conveyal website](https://docs.conveyal.com/prepare-inputs#preparing-the-osm-data). For adding customized costs for pedestrian and cycling analyses, see [this repository](https://github.com/RSGInc/ladot_analysis_dataprep).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A transit schedule dataset** in General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS.zip) format (optional):\n",
    "   - This data contains all the necessary information for calculating travel times based on public transport, such as stops, routes, trips and the schedules when the vehicles are passing a specific stop. You can read about the [GTFS standard here](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference).\n",
    "   - *Hint*: `r5py` can also combine multiple GTFS files, as sometimes you might have different GTFS feeds representing, e.g., the bus and metro connections. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data for origin and destination locations\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to OSM and GTFS datasets, you need data that represents the origin and destination locations (OD-data) for routings. This data is typically stored in one of the geospatial data formats, such as Shapefile, GeoJSON or GeoPackage. As `r5py` is built on top of `geopandas`, it is easy to read OD-data from various different data formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to get these datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few places from where you can download the datasets for creating the routable network:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenStreetMap data in PBF-format**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - [pyrosm](https://pyrosm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html#protobuf-file-what-is-it-and-how-to-get-one)  library. Allows downloading data directly from Python (based on GeoFabrik and BBBike).\n",
    "  - [pydriosm](https://pydriosm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start.html#download-data) library. Allows downloading data directly from Python (based on GeoFabrik and BBBike).\n",
    "  - [GeoFabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/) website. Has data extracts for many pre-defined areas (countries, regions, etc).\n",
    "  - [BBBike](https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/) website. Has data extracts readily available for many cities across the world. Also supports downloading data by [specifying your own area or interest](https://extract.bbbike.org/).\n",
    "  - [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com/downloads/osm) website. Allows to download the data with custom extent by specifying your own area of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GTFS data**:  \n",
    "  - [Transitfeeds](https://transitfeeds.com/) website. Easy to navigate and find GTFS data for different countries and cities. Includes current and historical GTFS data. Notice: The site will be deprecated in the future.  \n",
    "  - [Mobility Database](https://database.mobilitydata.org) website. Will eventually replace TransitFeeds. \n",
    "  - [Transitland](https://www.transit.land/operators) website. Find data based on country, operator or feed name. Includes current and historical GTFS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following tutorial, we use various open source datasets:\n",
    "- The point dataset for Helsinki has been obtained from [Helsinki Region Environmental Services](https://www.hsy.fi/en/environmental-information/open-data/avoin-data---sivut/population-grid-of-helsinki-metropolitan-area/) (HSY) licensed under a Creative Commons By Attribution 4.0. \n",
    "- The street network for Helsinki is a cropped and filtered extract of OpenStreetMap (© OpenStreetMap contributors, [ODbL license](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright))\n",

    "A travel time matrix is a dataset detailing the travel costs (e.g., time) between given locations (origins and destinations) in a study area. To compute a travel time matrix with `r5py` based on public transportation, we first need to initialize an `r5py.TravelTimeMatrixComputer` object. As inputs, we pass following arguments for the `TravelTimeMatrixComputer`:\n",
    "- `transport_network`, which we created in the previous step representing the routable transport network. \n",
    "- `origins`, which is a GeoDataFrame with one location that we created earlier (however, you can also use multiple locations as origins).\n",
    "- `destinations`, which is a GeoDataFrame representing the destinations (in our case, the `points` GeoDataFrame). \n",
    "- `departure`, which should be Python's `datetime` object (in our case standing for \"22nd of February 2022 at 08:30\") to tell `r5py` that the schedules of this specific time and day should be used for doing the calculations. \n",
    "   - *Note*: By default, `r5py` summarizes and calculates a median travel time from all possible connections within one hour from given depature time (with 1 minute frequency). It is possible to adjust this time window using `departure_time_window` parameter ([see details here]((https://r5py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html#r5py.RegionalTask))). \n",
    "- `transport_modes`, which determines the travel modes that will be used in the calculations. These can be passed using the options from the `TransitMode` and `LegMode` classes. \n",

    "### Compute travel times for different percentiles\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `r5py` calculates travel times for all possible transit departure possibilities within an hour (with one minute frequency), we basically get a distribution of travel times. It is possible to gather and return information about the travel times at different percentiles of this distribution based on all computed trips (sorted from the fastest to slowest connections). By default, the returned time in `r5py` is the median travel time (i.e. `50`). You can access these percentiles by using a parameter `percentiles` which accepts a list of integers representing different percentiles, such as `[25, 50, 75]` which returns the travel times at those percentiles:"
