**R⁵py** is a Python library for rapid realistic routing on multimodal
transport networks (walk, bike, public transport, and car).  It provides a
simple and friendly interface to R⁵, the Rapid Realistic Routing on
Real-world and Reimagined networks, a [routing
engine](https://github.com/conveyal/r5) developed by Conveyal. *r5py* is
inspired by [r5r, a wrapper for R](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/), and it is
designed to interact with [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/) GeoDataFrames.

*R5py* offers a simple way to run R⁵ locally with Python, allowing the users to
calculate travel time matrices and accessibility by different travel modes.  To
get started, take a look at the [user
manual](user-guide/user-manual/quickstart) that includes a detailed
demonstration of *r5py* in action.  Over time, *r5py* will be expanded to
incorporate other functionalities from R⁵.
